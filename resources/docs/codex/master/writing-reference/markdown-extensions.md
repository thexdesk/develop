# Markdown Extensions


### Attributes
You can assign any attribute to a block-level element. Just directly prepend or follow the block with a block inline attribute list.
That consists of a left curly brace, optionally followed by a colon, the attribute definitions and a right curly brace:

```markdown
> A nice blockquote
{: title="Blockquote title"}

{#id .class}
## Example attributed header
```

> A nice blockquote
{: title="Blockquote title"}

{#id .class}
###### Example attributed header

As with a block-level element you can assign any attribute to a span-level elements using a span inline attribute list,
that has the same syntax and must immediately follow the span-level element:

```markdown
This is *red*{style="color: red"}.
```

This is *red*{style="color: red"}.


### Task list

### Abbreviation

Markup is based on [php markdown extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#abbr) definition, but without multiline support:

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language

*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium

The HTML specification
is maintained by the W3C.

```markdown

```

### Footnote

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.


Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]
